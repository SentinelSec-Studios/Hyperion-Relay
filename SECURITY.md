## Reporting a Vulnerability

How to go about reporting security vulnerabilities and bugs.

To report a bug, create a new issue and describe the feature you were using the expected behiviour and the behaviour you observed. 
Additionally if possible please specify steps to recreate the issue.
You can expect a reply on security issues within 48 hours of issuing the report, if the vulnerability is accepted work will begin shortly after. 
If the vulnerability is dismissed/declined the issue will be closed. You may re-open an issue
if you discover more broken functionality that could further make the issue exploitable.
